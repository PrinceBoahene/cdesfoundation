		<h3>Inserting HTML comments</h3>
		<p>
			* Comments are ignored (not interpreted) by the browser <br>
			* You can use comments to decribe sections of codes or to give directions as to what a particular code does <br>
			* Comments can also be used to debug/track/fix problems in your code <br>
			* See how I've used comments to include appropriate notes and descriptions
		</p>

		<!--  place your comments inside this special tag -->

			Greetings from code-s!<br/>
